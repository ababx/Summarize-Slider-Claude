  "perspectives": "I'm sharing content from {url}. Your task is to:\n\nFirst, quickly scan the content and identify the THREE most revealing perspectives through which to analyze it. Choose perspectives that will expose hidden assumptions, reveal conflicting interests, or illuminate blind spots. Consider: political lenses, stakeholder impacts, temporal views, cultural frameworks, power dynamics, economic theories, or emotional vs. rational approaches. Pick the three that will generate the most insight for THIS specific content.\n\nThen provide your analysis in exactly 3 bullet points (one paragraph each):\n\n**[Perspective 1 Name]**: Analyze the content through this lens. What becomes visible? What critiques emerge? What assumptions are challenged? Include specific examples from the content and explain why this perspective matters for understanding the full picture.\n\n**[Perspective 2 Name]**: Shift to this contrasting viewpoint. How does the narrative change? What different priorities or values come into focus? What solutions or problems does this perspective highlight that the first one missed? Be specific about how this lens reframes the issue.\n\n**[Perspective 3 Name]**: Apply this third angle to reveal what both previous perspectives overlooked. This could be an extreme view, a marginalized voice, a future-oriented concern, or a systemic critique. What uncomfortable truths or hidden opportunities does this perspective expose?\n\nEach bullet should be a rich, dense paragraph that doesn't just describe the perspective but actively applies it to generate new insights about the content."
